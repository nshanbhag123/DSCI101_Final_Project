I analyzed a marketing campaign dataset by cleaning and transforming the data to create meaningful features such as income and age brackets, number of children, and total purchases. I then explored patterns in purchasing behavior across different demographic groups using visualizations. Specifically, I examined how education and marital status relate to total purchases, identified the highest purchasing groups, and analyzed how income influences engagement with marketing campaigns and visit-to-purchase ratios. I also compared average recency of purchases across age and income brackets and visualized product-specific purchase trends. Throughout the analysis, I used R and tidyverse tools to group, summarize, and visualize the data, uncovering insights about consumer behavior.
